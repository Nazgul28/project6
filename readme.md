 QUOTESONDEV - Web site built with Wordpress and AngularJS

In this project I could mix the Wordpress CMS and the AngularJS framework in order to use the WP_REST API pluggin and fetch data on the homepage.

Basically I intend to:
a) Fetch random posts on the homepage;
b) Accept new quote submissions from the front-end of the site (from logged in users only), and set those submissions to pending.
